## MVC Architecture
The Model View Controller (MVC) pattern is employed in the development of this login system. The MVC architecture separates the application into three components:

1. Model: The Model processes data retrieved from the database and handles related operations.
2. View: The View represents the user interface elements visible in the web browser.
3. Controller: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, processing user requests and triggering appropriate actions.

Note: The Model and the View do not directly communicate with each other.

## Advantages of MVC
The PHP Login System leverages the MVC pattern, providing the following advantages:

1. No Code Duplication: The separation of concerns in the MVC architecture helps eliminate redundant code, making the application more maintainable and reducing development time.
2. Encapsulation: Each component in MVC has a specific role, promoting encapsulation and improving code organization and readability.
3. Structured Programming: The MVC pattern enforces a structured approach to development, facilitating code reusability and modularization.
